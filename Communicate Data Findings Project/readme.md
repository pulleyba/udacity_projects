# San Francisco City Employee Compensation Exploration
## by Brice Pulley

## Dataset

> This is a dataset of employees of the City of San Francisco, from 2013-2019, that includes nearly 330,000 entries. The data was gathered from [DataSF](https://datasf.org/), which is an opensource data site helping the city to thrive through the use of data. Most of the content is provided the local government of the City of San Francisco. An online data query web app was used to filter out an initial dataset and then exported to a local computer. This dataset explores total compensation which is made of up salaries and benefits, and contains information about the job, the year, department, etc. 

## Summary of Findings

> The main variable that contributed to total compensation was total salary. The base salary was the biggest contributor of that part. The differences in the 6 components that make up total compensation varied greatly depending on the type of job and the organization it was clustered in. The top 5 jobs included: Nurse, Transit Operator, Police Officer, Firefighter, and Custodian. Of these jobs, the Police Officer, Firefighter, and Transit Operator had the most variability in pay. These jobs have odd hours/schedules which are big contributors and also have the opportunity for overtime. Also, some Firefighters and Police Officers do not pay certain taxes which lowers their contribution for total compensation. The Custodian had the lowest median pay and the smallest range of compensation mostly do because this is considered an 'unskilled' laborer. These positions do not have the opportunity for as much growth and most people probably do not stay in long enough to have huge increases in compensation. Nurses tended to have the most structured and stable pay system. They also had the highest median total compensation. This most likely is do to the fact that they are considered the most "skilled" or 'educated' workers. Hence, why they have the highest earnings. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The main focus will be the interaction between Total Salary and Total Benefit based on the differences in the top 5 most employed jobs. Also, exploring the distribution of Total Compensation between the top jobs.
